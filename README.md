# M4lw4r3

## What is M4lw4r3?
M4lw4r3 is a Python program that detects malicious DDoS threats and uses the Python 'scapy' library to analyse network traffic with packet inspection, using algorithms and mathematical pattern recognition to identify and prevent malicious attacks in under 500 lines of code. This project is a work in progress and is intended to be built upon to make it into what it was designed to become.

## Checklist
- [x] Create Prototype

## APIs
This project uses closed source APIs that are a work in progress and likely will not be released to the public due to licensing agreements. Therefore, someone should create an open source alternative to any closed-source APIs.

## Prototype
This is a prototype and will likely need to be updated to run on the reader's own machine, with URLs and possible keys needing to be updated as well.

## Name
The name M4lw4r3 stands for Malware Detection. It is a combination of the words Malware and Detection. The name was chosen because it is a fitting name for a program that detects malicious DDoS threats.
